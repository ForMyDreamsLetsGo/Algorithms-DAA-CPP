# Algorithms-DAA-CPP
A Repository of original programs written by me. These contain C++ programs for commonly taught algorithms in a Design and Analysis of Algorithms course . You are free to use thema as you want but i will like it if you attribute me(these took hardwork after all＞﹏＜) :).

The programs use C++11 and are tested to work correctly on compilers supporting c++17 (My compiler was "g++ (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 11.3.0")

These programs make heavy use of C++ STL and don't use custom classes or manual memory management i.e. they use the "good,modern,standard & recommended" approach. 

No particular design strategy has been followed as they are made for college submission purposes. 

All the programs require text file input in command line while running. sample files have been provided for reference about the kind of files are accepted. It is assumed that the user understands which algorithm requires which kind of input Files. 
//update 16=10-23. added respective txt file names for cpp files
// format to run in cmd
  cd file location / <program_name>.exe <file_name>
    ex:- Dijkstra.exe undirected-weighted-graph.txt
         Topological_sort.exe digraph-int.txt
         prim.exe undirected_weighted_graph.txt
         DFS.exe undirected -unweighted-graph.txt
         BFS.exe digraph-char.txt
         

Any Modifications, suggestions, documentation, or addition of new algorithms for completness are always welcome . New submissions are expected to follow the design policy or a better one than existing ones as much as possible.(Well they must not atleast be copy/paste programs one can find anywhere)

Many programs like knapsack.cpp use novel approaches like bottom up recursion which may take some time to get used to. So anyone using these programs is humbly requested to add some documentation for new-comers if they have got time. Thanks! 

//update 16/10/23
added 2 pdf files(daa1.pdf & daa2.pdf) for ready refernce of new comers . please go through them to understand the working , expected input&output
